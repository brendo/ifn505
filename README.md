# ðŸŽ“ IFN505: Analysis of Programs

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/brendo/ifn505.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brendo/ifn505)

Practical exercises from QUT's unit [IFN505: Analysis of Programs](https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=IFN505).

In an attempt to keep myself accountable, I'm aiming to commit all programming related exercises from the tutorials to this repository.

Exercises will most likely be completed using Javascript, but because Python interests me, I'll likely flip between the two languages.

If you spot an error, let me know, I am learning after all ðŸ˜Š
